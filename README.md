# ResNEXT
The method used here, which is called ResNEXT (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8100117), is mainly an extension and modification on ResNet (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780459).

ResNet is a widely-used convolutional neural network and has achieved great success in image classification tasks. ResNEXT repeats a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. Shortly, it is a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture. The following figure shows the key idea of ResNEXT.
